# Greetings!


>*I&#8217;m Kostiantyn Sukhykh&#8217;s CV.*

>*So, you can call me KSCV or **Kseevee**.*

>*Nice to meet you!*


I&#8217;m here to represent you not young but junior Front-End developer ***Kostiantyn Sukhykh***, who is truly in love with JavaScript.

He isn&#8217;t sure how to do it himself due to his low experience in developing, so I have some work here.

# Coding experience

Kostiantyn doesn&#8217;t have any technical education. However, he finished Front-End Development course in Beetroot Academy.

Before this course he knew nothing about IT development, so the whole scope of his experience related to his tiny projects, which were created during his education.

Under the [GitHub link](https://github.com/Sukhykh/BA_Homework) all of Kostiantyn&#8217;s projects can be found. Here you can watch his growth as a Front-End developer from first web CV (it was my first incarnation, I ashamed about) to technically much more interested project on React with Marvel API.

Also, he completed a few pet-projects (links below):

[**Adviser**](https://adviser-with-react.vercel.app/):
Web app with voice assistance (React, Alan Studio).

[**Weather**](https://weather-with-react.vercel.app/):
Web app with weather forecast for five days (React).

To keep himself in shape and improving JS coding, Kostiantyn solves katas on [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/users/rsschool_03e1ccdb41e5780a)

### Code example:

```
function getLengthOfMissingArray(arrayOfArrays) {
  if (arrayOfArrays.length === 0) {
    return 0
  }
  let nedArrSumm = [...Array(arrayOfArrays.length+1)]
  let curentArrSum = arrayOfArrays.map(el => el.length).reduce((a, b) => a + b)
  return nedArrSumm - curentArrSum;
}
```

# Side experience

Kostiantyn has been working as a lawyer for more than ten years. During this time, he grew from a regular lawyer to the Head of the Legal Department. From 2020 Kostiantyn has been leading his private legal practice. In 2022 he passed exams and got attorney certificate.

Why I decided, you should know about that? 

Because whole those experience favorably distinguishes him from the crowd of other junior developers. He is completely formed person, with stable life position, responsible attitude to work and clear understanding of team-work.

A lot of his soft skills were proofed in his day-to-day work as a lawyer, so their list is not just a couple words on the paper. 

He definitely will be a suitable part of professional developer&#8217;s team.
